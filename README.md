- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Some notes from Ryan:

- Make sure to get the prettier and eslint extension in VS Code.
  - These are set to warning so you may override them if they are bugging you
  - I just used the default format settings

## More notes from Ryan on how to run the app!

-Downlaod the Expo Go app on the App Store!!!
- After you run the npx expo start command press the letter [s] to go into "go" mode
  - If you don't press [s] you will be stuck in build mode and your app will not launch
  - We can switch to build mode if we actually need to deploy the app (high unlikely)

## More notes from Ryan on pr's and merging:

- It's fine if you assign and approve your own pr's
  - Just make sure that your pr passes the automated check by the expo bot before merging!!!!!
